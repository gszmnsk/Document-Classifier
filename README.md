The project is mainly focused around the classical approach to computer vision and data compression as those are the things I wanted to learn by creating this project. It is far from perfect and is indeed still in the making process. The greatest accuracy score was not the main issue covered in the project although it is pretty much accurate.
# Scanned document classification based on its structure.

Methods used:
<ul>
<li>OpenCV, ORB for points detection and extraction</li>
<li>Kmedoids for clustering and codebook making</li>
<li>Vector Quantization for as a data compression method</li>
<li>CNN as a Deep Learning classifier</li>
<li>Flask for model testing</li>
</ul>
